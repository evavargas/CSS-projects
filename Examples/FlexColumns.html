          For a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put
          out my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time
          to say &quot;I'm going to sleep.&quot;
        </aside>
        <main>
          And half an hour later the thought that it was time to go to sleep
          would awaken me; I would try to put away the book which, I imagined,
          was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I had been thinking
          all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just been reading, but
          my thoughts had run into a channel of their own, until I myself seemed
          actually to have become the subject of my book: a church, a quartet,
          the rivalry between Fran√ßois I and Charles V.

            This impression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it
            did not disturb my mind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and
            prevented them from registering the fact that the candle was no
            longer burning.

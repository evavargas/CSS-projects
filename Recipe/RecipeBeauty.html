          Fried eggs are fried only on one side, so that the yolk is liquid and
          can be spread with bread. <br />
          Although their cooking procedure seems simple, there are many people
          who leave them too raw or overcooked, <br />
          so the yolk hardens and there is no turning back.

          <li>Put 3 tablespoons of oil for frying or 300 gr. butter in the pan and

            water.<br />
            This trick is used to know if the oil temperature is adequate to
            cook the fried egg perfectly.</li>
          <li>Break the egg gently so that the yolk does not melt, and drop it on
            the butter or oil.</li>
          <li>Lower the heat to a minimum and let the egg cook. <br />
            When it is already white and still visually perceive that it is raw,
            pour ½ teaspoon of water on the pan<br />
            and cover it with its corresponding lid so that the yolk is cooked
            and the white becomes firmer.</li>
          <li>Remove the fried egg with a slotted spoon below it when you notice
            that the yolk is thick but in turn liquid inside.</li>
          <li>Serve immediately and accompany it with fresh or toasted bread,
            Cuban-style rice, onion steaks, beans, sausages, and so on.<br />
            and enjoy It!</li></ol>
